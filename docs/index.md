Transformation of the [gov.uk UK local authority and regional greenhouse gas emissions national statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-local-authority-and-regional-greenhouse-gas-emissions-national-statistics) dataset. 

This transformation updates statistics for former local authorities to their modern replacements, creates statistics for higher level authorities, and adds three letter authority codes for comparison with other datasets. 

This dataset is ingested by the [Climate Action Plan Explorer](https://data.climateemergency.uk/).
